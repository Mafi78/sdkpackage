Some of the radio buttons can be configured as inactive (they are displayed as grayed out). The grouped radio buttons can be arranged within different number of columns. Based on the number of specified columns and the number of radio buttons used, different layout types can be achieved - as a 'matrix', horizontally or vertically aligned radio buttons, etc."
